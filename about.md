Hi,I am Risyad. I'm that ordinary hobbyist who enjoy creating fancy
letterforms and learning how to code.

I love to write words in fancy letterforms with calligraphy and lettering. And
sometimes, I write codes to make my life easier. Just kidding. So far I only
code for fun.

And sometimes, I blog! How awesome is that?!
