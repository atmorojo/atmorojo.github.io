It's a pain to set everything from the start when you get a new machine. So I put almost all of my dotfilesto a folder, and create a git repository for it.

[Here is the link](https://github.com/atmorojo/Dotfiles) to the mentioned repository. I don't think that you'll be interested, though. But I'll put it here anyway.

Have a nice day :)
