Yes! Finally the new design for my blog is almost done! Hope I can finish this soon. I can't wait to start blogging and put my nonsenses here!

In the redesign process I learned so much things that I never encounter before. Even the codebase is still messy, I kinda get to know what should I remove from the codebase to keep it clean and simple.

How do you think of the redesign? If you find it disgusting please forgive me ðŸ˜‚. I you have any constructive critics, please let me know!
